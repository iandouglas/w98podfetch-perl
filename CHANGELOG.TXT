Changes in 0.61 from 0.60
- non-buffered output by suggestion of a user
- added a --debug option which will print copious amounts of debugging text;
	handy to use when sending bug reports; likewise added lots of "if $debug"
	checks throughout the code for printing this debug info; use in partner with
	the --verbose flag
- expanded the use of the --verbose flag in conjunction with the --debug
	option.
- added a cmdline flag for running a single podcast; see the usage for help on
	using this flag with your configuration
- rearranged how some of the code gets sorted to avoid bugs with feeds whose
	enclosure descriptions contain certain characters
- enabled the enclosure pubDate for date sorting
- fixed a bug from mantis where a podcast url could contain regular expression
	syntax and causing crashes
- readme file contains information on setting w98podfetch as a Windows
	service; many thanks to Mike who sent me the information. I didn't want to
	publicize his Email address without his permission.
